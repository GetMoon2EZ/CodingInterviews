# Coding Interviews

# Overview

This repo stores every solution I found to some conding interview problems.

Each problem has its own folder, matching the problem name. The solution consists of a single C file in which the `main` function calls the solving function. For each problem, a `README.md` file describes the problem, the input and ouput format as well as the constrains in detail.

## Checking for correctness

Since I don't have an oracle, the correctness of the answer can only be demonstrated logically. If the problem stems from a coding challenge website that as an oracle, then the code of the solving function can be copy/pasted there for verification.
